micopi
======

Micopi allows you to assign an image to every person in your telephone's contact list. So if you do not happen to have a (decent) photo of them, you can use the app to simply generate one.
Micopi does not use a random number generator to create these images. It exclusively uses contact data such as the name, the telephone number or the e-mail address and turns these into geometric figures and colours. This way, all of your contacts have their unique image.
This app has been thoroughly tested but we recommend making a backup of your most precious contact pictures, just in case.
